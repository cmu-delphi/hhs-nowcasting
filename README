# Nowcasting Reported COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using De-Identified, Aggregated Medical Insurance Claims Data

This directory contains code and data for "Nowcasting Reported COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using De-Identified, Aggregated Medical Insurance Claims Data". The preprint is available at 
(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.22.23300471v1)

The entire nowcasting process and its analysis could be reproduced in the `code` folder. However producing nowcasts takes around 2 weeks of CPU time. For this reason we have made predictions available at TODO. Downloading these predictions would allow reproduction of figures in the paper with minimal effort.
