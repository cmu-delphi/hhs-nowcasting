This folder includes the necessary script for producing plots in section 2. Specifically, each 
subfolder does the following:
- `analysis_script` includes the scripts computing national average correlation, mean absolute 
percentage error, and missingness for both inpatient and outpatient features.
- `plot_script` contains scripts for plotting figure 1, 2 in paper. Each document is named with the plots it produces.
- `RDS`: stores computation result from scripts in `analysis_script` for faster plot production.
